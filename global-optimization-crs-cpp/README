# CRS Optimizer with Sparse Matrix and OpenMP Integration

This project is high-performance C++ implementation of the Controlled Random Search (CRS) algorithm for global optimization, with

- Compressed Row Storage (CRS) style sparse matrix class
- Modular and object-oriented design
- OpenMP support for potential parallelism

## Features

- CRS algorithm implementation (Price 1977)
- SparseMatrix class with CRS structure
- Logging of function statistics (min, max, mean)
- MyMatrix.data stores entire cloud per iteration
- Python script for visualizing optimization progress
- Extension to large-scale using HPC runs is doable


## Visualize (after running)
